Designed, financed, built, operated, and maintained by the people of New York, the canal was one of the largest public works projects ever attempted anywhere in the world when the first shovel of earth was turned near Rome, New York, on July 4, 1817. Men with talent and vision (but little training in engineering) charted the 363-mile course of the canal between Albany and Buffalo. They designed stone aqueducts to carry boats across rivers and locks to lift them over New York\u2019s varied terrain. Thousands of laborers dug the ditch itself and built massive reservoirs to ensure the canal was constantly supplied with water. When it was completed in 1825, the Erie Canal connected the port of New York City on the Atlantic Ocean with the Great Lakes, dramatically transforming trade, industry, and communication in the region and across the country.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>The Erie Canal was so successful that it was enlarged three times to accommodate more traffic and increasingly larger vessels. Great cities and commerce grew along the Erie Canal. Diverse people traveled east and west across its length, some spreading powerful ideas for social change. In the mid-twentieth century, canal traffic began to decline, and the famous waterway momentarily faded from public use, only to reemerge today as a vehicle for heritage tourism, recreation, and education.<\/span><\/p>",

          "text": "<h4>Access to the Interior</h4><p>Until the construction of the Erie Canal, New Orleans had nearly exclusive access to trade with the rich interior of North America because of its location on the Mississippi River. Beginning in the seventeenth century during French, Dutch, and then British competition for the fur trade in North America, people realized that New York City, with its deep and protected harbor and access to the interior via the Hudson River, was strategically situated for trade with Europe. As early as 1724, Cadwallader Colden, surveyor general and later colonial governor of the Province of New York, prepared a report for the governor describing the natural \"water courses and carrying places\" (portages) between Albany and Montreal, Canada, and between Albany and Cataraqui Lake, now known as Lake Ontario. It took another one hundred years before the New York Corresponding Association for the Promotion of Internal Improvements was organized to advance support for building a canal across New York State—a project they envisioned as the starting point for a cross-country navigation system of waterways bridging Lake Erie with the Atlantic Ocean, the Mississippi River, and the western states of Michigan and Illinois.</p>"

The Erie Canal, and subsequent rail lines and highways, followed the earliest migration and trade routes of the people of Six Nations (Haudenosaunee) in territory that is now the State of New York. From earliest pre-contact settlements to present day communities, most people have always lived along the \"L\" shaped curve, from Greenwich Village at New York Harbor up to Albany, then westward towards Syracuse and on to Buffalo at Lake Erie. The myriad rivers and lakes along this route avoid the Northeast Appalachian ranges of the Hudson Highlands, the Taconics, the Catskills or the Adirondacks.</p><p>Controlling access to the water routes in New York was a critical aspect of ongoing land and trade disputes between various native and European groups from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries: between the Haudenosaunee and the Algonquin peoples; the French and the British; the Americans and the British. Continuing through the War of 1812, conflicts centered on controlling the use of major waterways, from the Atlantic Ocean at the port of New York to the Great Lakes at Buffalo Harbor and Irondequoit Bay.</p>"

However, the Eastern seaboard states remained separated from the interior of the country by the imposing Appalachian mountain range. Canals had been attempted elsewhere, but the elevations were too great to allow for a viable canal anywhere except New York. The only place where it was physically possible to build a canal to the Great Lakes without going over mountains was north through the Hudson Valley and west through the Mohawk Valley of New York.</p><p>The Hudson River provided a highly navigable waterway to the interior of New York as Henry Hudson discovered when he sailed up the river in 1609 in search of a passage to the Orient. Though the rapids of the Mohawk River prevented him from going further west, his discovery of the river later bearing his name would encourage other Dutch and then English to establish settlements along this broad waterway. The profitable fur trade and the opening of western territories in the Great Lakes region continued to spur innovative thinking and discussion about an overland route across New York.</p>"

In 1802, a syndicate of Dutch investors, known as the Holland Land Company, purchased an enormous tract of land in Western New York, hoping, like many post-revolutionary speculators, to sell their land for a quick profit. However, the company was forced to make substantial investments in roads and canals to attract buyers, including granting over 100,000 acres of their western lands for the canal route. The final tracts were not sold until 1837 after the Erie Canal was completed.</p><p>In 1810, Simeon De Witt, the Surveyor General for the State of New York who was responsible for supervising the division of the western part of the state into townships, was also appointed to the Erie Canal Commission. He was joined in 1816 by land surveyor Joseph Ellicott, who was also working for the Holland Land Company. Ellicott, along with his brothers, Andrew and Benjamin, and William Peacock and James Geddes were instrumental in mapping out the best route across the state for the Canal.</p>"

On March 13, 1810, the State Senate passed a measure establishing a Canal Commission and directing its commissioners to explore and propose a route for a canal connecting the Hudson River to the Great Lakes. Though the War of 1812 would cause a temporary delay in moving the project forward, the conflict itself underscored the need for inland transportation networks to protect American interests.</p><p>In 1817, DeWitt Clinton was elected governor of New York, running on a pro-canal platform. In April, the project was approved for funding in the legislature. Clinton's political fortunes rose and fell with the popularity of the canal project, often referred to as “Clinton’s Big Ditch” or “Clinton’s Folly” by his adversaries.
